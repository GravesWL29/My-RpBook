#Welcome to MyRPBook!

Do you love food? Do you love to cook but can never seem to find your favoirte recipes or have them scattered about? 

##Well not anymore!

We made MyRPBook as a way of easily keeping all of your favorite recipes in one place, your MyBook!
Once you login in, you will be redirected to your MyBook where you can update your current recipes, delete old ones, or add new ones that you have found.

If you are looking for inspiration for your cooking, check out the World Book! Here you can search thousands of recipes to help spark your cookking. Each recipe will have a list of ingridients and a link to the full recipe to take a look at.

We always value feedback so if there are any feature you would like to see added or expanded upon, feel free to reach out to one of us and we can look into adding it.

#Happy Cooking!

API Documentation:

We are using an API from the company Edamam, which is a food recipe repository. It is in the function WorldBook in the WorldBook,js file. The response we get from the Api gets processed in our Recipe.js and RecipeDetails.js files. The information we are looking to get from each APi response are the title of the recipe, the ingridients and the number of calories from each. That inforation then just used in the Worldbook.js to be disploayed below each image when clicked on.
